Look at Codes

### Head Notes
* Title should be within the head tag

Codes Below:

<head>
<title>
This Is The Part That Gets Searched (Search Query)

* Make Sure that there is an unique title
* A couple of words
* No "Untitled" or "Webpage 1" etc.

</title>
<meta name="description=" content="Basically, this is supposed to give a description">

</head>

### Tricks to URLs

* Use Words in URLs
* Avoid Excessive Keywords
* Use 1 URL

### Tricks to the Website Itself
* Allow for partial URLs to bring you to your page
* Allow people to use html since Java/Flash may not always work
