# First Task
> This is for all people who are just starting off and have never navigated Github or used markdown :grin:

> :neutral_face: :confused:Why should I learn this?:sleepy:

> This is essential, because github is :sparkles:*the place where you will showcase your work*:sparkles:, 
> and markdown is the :sunglasses:**cool coder language** :sunglasses:that you will use to do it!

> Through this lesson, you will be able to learn 

> 1. What is github
> 2. How to navigate Github (for our purposes)
> 3. How to use markdown to submit replies to ontouchstart's issues and lessons

Please Note: At anytime something does not make sense, send LivingProgram (email: kyhan316@gmail.com) a message, this way the lesson can be improved for others 
down the line (plus your confusion can be cleared up)


### Basic Vocabulary :
>For navigating github

Github is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. Github contains many, many "repositories" which are projects like the d3-playground. The entire d3-playground will be referred to as a "repository".

In github we will only be concerned about two sections, the main code section:

and the issues:

The main code section contains two things, files and folders: 

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16373135/14814830/0508a4f8-0b76-11e6-87a2-c9165189c939.png) ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16373135/14814857/23abea1e-0b76-11e6-8f5f-c878f5d01a61.png)

In the files is where you will be writing/saving your code and your files belong in folders. Everything we will be editing and posting will be in the gh-pages branch:

![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16373135/14814935/8b788ce2-0b76-11e6-9888-6998ba2d4145.png)

This branch is specially named so that github will turn all of the content inside the branch directly into a webpage, and webpages are what we will be working with. 

Finally we have the issues, for our purposes issues will be where you post your work and discuss with other students what you have learned. It can also be the place for you to ask questions. More of an introduction to issues will be presented after you have done the preliminary steps and learned how to use markdown.

> note: in github, saving a file or folder stays forever in the history and that is what makes github unique. Saving is called "comitting so everytime you commit you will see something like this:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16373135/14815173/cd6b7370-0b77-11e6-9777-2047ccbbfe61.png)
and the first line is a title for the commit while the second box is where you type your description.

### Preliminary Steps:
> These are the preliminary steps before you can do anything to get your "workshop" set up.

1. Make sure you have the capability to edit files:
   * ontouchstart will give you permission to edit files after you sign up in the issue here: https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground/issues/9
   * after you have confirmed that ontouchstart has given you permission to edit, you may move on.
2. Create your own folder:
  1. Make sure you are in [the repository](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground)
  2. Click "New File"
  3. Type "Your Username", then a "/"
  4. Put the "Year", then a "/"
  5. Put the "Month", then a "/"
  6. Put the "Day", then a "/"
  7. Finally put "README.md" (README's are documents written in markdown language, and almost every folder should have a README as it help others to understand the folder's content. You will notice that it always appears at the bottom of any folder:) ![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16373135/14815318/aacdd4f6-0b78-11e6-8f0f-b97a937e8069.png)
  8. Type in a title and description at the bottom, and "Commit New File"
  
:+1: You just made a file!
Everyday you do work, you have to make a new folder for the date and do work in that folder for the day. 

In order to reply to issues and ontouchstart's lessons, you have to learn markdown... 

### Learning Markdown
> read everything below, before continuing 
(click this...) :point_right:[Here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) are some basic features in markdown, 
and they are enough for you to write comments in the issues, or write markdown files.

[This](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a cheatsheet which includes similar information but also a couple extra things.

Now you will experiment with every single markdown element, because you will need all of them. Learn through usage and not memorization.


For every element in the [reference](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) you must experiment with the element by creating you own example (and learning the syntax). So create another file in your folder titled: "practice.md" (note that the ".md" extension signifies a markdown file. In this file practice all of the elements and save them. 
> Remember to make a new folder in your folder every single day (with a new date)

Then you will condense all of your work onto one file and post your work here: https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground/issues/21
through a comment.

### For the Future
Now that you have learned markdown you will learn jekyll, so once again, sign up in [this issue](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground/issues/45). Ontouchstart will give you access to the jekyll-playground where you will start on the first lessons and finish the course. 

Afterwards you will learn javascript through d3.js and node.js, d3.js is taught in this repository with [this](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground/issues/23) being the first assignment. After finishing an assignment simply move onto the next issue. 
> Note that all the issues are closed so you will have to click closed to see all of the issues:
![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/16373135/14815591/4e672e04-0b7a-11e6-9da6-ca25c1b80d3a.png)
and just look for issue 24. 

After learning d3.js you will learn node.js by signing up [here](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground/issues/32). 

Good luck!
