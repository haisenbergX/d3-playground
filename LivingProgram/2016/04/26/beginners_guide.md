# First Task
> This is for all people who are just starting off and have never navigated Github or used markdown :grin:

> :neutral_face: :confused:Why should I learn this?:sleepy:

> and markdown is the :sunglasses:**cool coder language** :sunglasses:that you will use to do it!

> Through this lesson, you will be able to learn 

> 1. What is github
> 2. How to navigate Github (for our purposes)
> 3. How to use markdown to submit replies to ontouchstart's issues and lessons

down the line (plus your confusion can be cleared up)


### Basic Vocabulary :
>For navigating github

> Note that for our purposes, 

> 1. Issues are where you can post your work 
> 2. Don't worry about pull requests or forking
> 3. gh-pages is the only branch

Now that you know what github is lets get started!:joy: 

### Preliminary Steps:
1. Make sure you have the capability to edit files
2. Create your own folder:
  1. Make sure you are in [the repo](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground)
  2. Click "New File"
  3. Type "Your Username", then a "/"
  4. Put the "Year", then a "/"
  5. Put the "Month", then a "/"
  6. Put the "Day", then a "/"
  7. Finally put "README.md" (README's help others to understand the folder's content
  8. Type in a title and description at the bottom, and "Commit New File"
  
:+1: You just made a file!

In order to reply to issues, and make **markdown files**, you have to learn markdown... :smirk:
### Learning Markdown
> read everything below, before continuing 
(click this...) :point_right:[Here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) are some basic features in markdown, 
and they are enough for you to write comments, or files.

[This](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) is a cheatsheet (which also includes how to embed **cool videos** 
like the ones above)

What do you do now :question:

Well here is where you have fun :grinning: :wink:

"Play around" with every single markdown element, because you will need all of them. 

1. Make a new folder every single day (with new date)
2. Make a new file for every single element
3. Have fun, make weird tables or lists, explain lists in a list, etc...
4. After doing all elements, create a single file that showcases your knowledge of markdown and includes all markdown elements.
## Learn through USAGE not memorization
> if you don't remember some of the stuff now, don't worry, later on when you **use** it you **will remember**
Go Ahead.
