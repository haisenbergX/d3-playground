### Objective:
Attempt to fix the problems from the first prototype.

### [First Prototype](https://github.com/bigdata-mindstorms/d3-playground/tree/gh-pages/LivingProgram/2016/04/06)

### Problems:
1. Connect the yaml data file to the functions so the client can input data on the data file.
2. Add open graph protocol tags 
3. ~~Making functions which can easily add tags to any page within the website (not just the homepage), so that each page also has different titles, keywords, descriptions~~ 

> There is no reason to add tags to all the pages because their content is pretty similar throughout, only for big websites with lots of keywords

**Problems 1 and 2 will be solved easily, ~~3 will take some creative thought.~~**
