## gh-pages

This branch is setup as [gh-pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/), which means there is a mapping between each file in your folder and a web page URL: for example:
[ontouchstart/2016/01/01/append_h1.js](ontouchstart/2016/01/01/append_h1.js) is mapped to this URL:
